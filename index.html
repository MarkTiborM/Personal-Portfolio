                <p>Hi there, my name is Mark Mezei</p> I am a Business/Software Data Analyst Student with a strong background in Python programming, databases, and systems.</p>
                <h2 class="sub-title">Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                <h3 1. </h3>1. What motivated you to pursue a career as a business/software data analyst?</p>
                <p>answer: My passion for leveraging technology to benefit others is what drew me to pursue a career in computer science. I have always been intrigued by the power of the internet to connect people and create positive change.</p>
                <h3 2. </h3>2. What kind of projects have you worked on in your studies or previous experience?</p>
                <p>answer: Had my initial encounter with Python while working in a group for a biology assignment during a workshop held at our school. I was able to work with another group member to create and maintain a program that connected to the current state of Biology. The main objective of the assignment was to develop an interactive element that was somehow connected to the field of biology to inform those interacting with the workshop.</p>
                
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;" >Had utilized interactive elements from Mediapipe and CV2 to able to plot points of interest, such as the names of bones and joints, and color code them accordingly. This allowed for an engaging way of showcasing important bone strucutures and muscle groups for young kids. </li>
